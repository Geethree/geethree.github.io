Technical Experience
--------------------

Software/System Design
:   Production ready systems should be modular, tested and well documented. Development environments and deployments must to be reliable, repeatable and consistently deployed/monitored to ensure there is no drift from code to infrastructure.

	Extensive experience with the following:

    * **Build systems**: Bassel, Gradle, Lerna, Maven, Tox
    * **CI/CD**: AWS CodePipeline, Buildkite, CircleCI, Jenkins, Travis
    * **Cloud Infrastructure**: All things compute, networking, storage, security, AI/ML related to AWS or GCP
    * **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Puppet, Terraform
    * **Containers/Micro-services**: Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, ECS, Jib, Kubernetes
    * **Development Environments**: AWS Cloud9, Docker, Intellij, Vagrant
    * **IT/Networking**: Manage 3Scan's AS, BGP peering with multiple ISPs and AWS. Cisco/JunoOs you name it!
    * **Languages**: Bash, C, C++, Groovy, Java, Javascript, .Net, Node, Python, Scala, Typescript
    * **Monitoring/Telemetry**: Centralized logging, Elk, Grafana, Graphite, Prometheus
    * **Operating Systems**: At home in linux or windows
    * **Testing**: Junit, PyTest
    * **Version Control**: Git, Github, Gitlab, Phabricator

Engineering Management
:   Together we can create something that any individual or single team can imagine!

    * **Agile methodologies**: Applied to both software and hardware
    * **Project management**: From gantt charts and QFDs to task management and KPIs
    * The customer experience is key, dog-fooding is a must
    * Have overseen complex multi-disciplinary teams from 2 to 20 engineers 

Fluidics Design
:   A beautifully complex field that has enabled humans to reach the moon, or replace a worn aortic valve. 

    * **CFD**: Fluent, Solidworks

Mechanical Design
:   Machinist in my heart. Deep knowledge of kinematics, rapid prototyping, Newtonian mechanics, gears, and standardized materials

    * **CAD**: Solidworks, Creo/ProE
    * **FEA**: Abaqus, Solidworks, Creo
